                        <p>Since WPC manufacturing starts as a paste, it can be molded to any shape and size. This flexibility extends also to color and texture. From a functional point of view, the moisture-resistant property of WPC products allows for better structural integrity while also allowing the material to retain its aesthetics longer.</p>
