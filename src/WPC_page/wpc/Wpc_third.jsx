                    <div className="wpc__p2__first-p">
                        WPC looks and feels like wood, allowing carpenters the convenience of using the same tools used on wood. Being a manufactured product, it is consistent in design and texture, while having additional mechanical and physical properties over natural wood. So it's an intelligent alternative to wood that is eco-friendly and helps preserve our green cover, while at the same time, it helps save valuable time, energy, and money.
